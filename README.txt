Hello! My name is Patrick Crowley and I am a junior in high school currently attending a computer programming technical shop. 

I enjoy making small games and apps for my computer using Python, including this ASCII image generator

When an image is loaded in, the program will run and output a file of the ASCII image in the same file location
(GIFS will work SOME OF THE TIME. This program is not finished and needs a lot of work. PNG or JPEG images work perfectly however.
I apologize if things do not work the way they are supposed to.)

Enjoy :)
